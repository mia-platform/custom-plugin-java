# custom-plugin-java
Library that allows you to define Mia-Platform custom plugins in java easily

## Purpouse

This plugin aims to provide an easy way to integrate the Platform.

It is able to integrate either the CRUD and other REST services.
The underlying library which enables the possibility to operate with external service is Retrofit, although the user (developer) wouldn't use this in his code. 

## Internal Architecture

This plugin is framework-independent. Every functionality is built using plain Java code.
